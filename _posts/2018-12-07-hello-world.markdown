# Hello, world!

We just kicked off our Scrum Team for the dlp (DLP/Digital Library Program) effort, starting development on our first two products, Curate and "Disco" (pending its final name).

Part of our startup work also involves getting our Scrum ducks in a row, and we've been scaffolding our internal processes and understanding of critical work entities into some very interesting outputs: glossary/definitions, entity hierarchies, process maps, tool recommendations, and templates.

After spending significant time collecting requirements ahead of a large platform migration, it's now time to shift into Agile. That meant compiling a large backlog of epic user stories for what ultimately turned out to be multiple products, and analyzing the warehouse of stories to generalize them into key product features. That then informed our v.1/MVP roadmaps which I'll be adding to our github wiki soon.

Since we're doing so much setup and startup work, it seemed like a great time to blog our progress along the way.
