Sometimes I run into cool packages, open source projects, plugins, etc. and they are definitely productivity boosters. However I keep forgetting where I saved the link or sometimes forget the name of the hipster-sounding package names. Therefore I'd like to start a post to keep these random but useful technologies together. This list will grow.
