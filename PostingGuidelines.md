How To Post
===========
* Checkout the latest version of the [repository](https://github.com/emory-libraries/emory-libraries.github.io)
* Create a new branch for your post
* Make sure you have an entry for your username in `_data/_authors.yml`
* Create a file in the `_posts` directory of the format `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md`
* In the above file, include the below header information. Note the author field links to the reference in `_data/_authors.yml`:
```
---
layout: post
title: THE TITLE
categories: [Jekyll]
author: yang_li
---
```
* Write your post
*  On GitHub create a [pull request](https://github.com/emory-libraries/emory-libraries.github.io/compare?expand=1) for others to review
*  All can ask questions and add comments, but the Ringleader for the iteration has the responsibility to review and merge (or not merge) the pull request to the main branch.  If the post is by the current Ringleader, or the Ringleader is unavailable due to being sick or on vacation, the responsibility falls to the next person on the list.
